\author{matteo bonanomi}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The present guide aims at providing some guidelines for the optimization of any Linux distro on Asus E200HA. It is not an easy task, since the tiny netbook has not a Linux-friendly hardware (Intel Cherrytrail... looking at you!), yet it can be a decent machine for school/university purposes. I am going to list what I have learned after about six months using this netbook for web browsing, office applications and coding coding coding. Feel free to share these pieces of information, contact me via GitHub and ask for improvements. Enjoy!
