# Asus E200HA: Linux distro installation and optimization guidelines

This manual aims at providing guidelines for the installation of Linux distros on 
Asus E200HA. This little and cheap netbook is not able to have decent performance with Windows 
and its ridiculous memory (32GB!!!) can't be enough for the heavy proprietary OS. Unfortunately, 
the hardware (Intel Cherrytrail... looking at you!) is not as linux-friendly as it should be, 
yet some good improvements can be made. I can guarantee that running Lubuntu or Manjaro Linux on this netbook provides
a user experience far way more confortable than Windows does. 

## Getting Started
At the time of writing, I am mostly working on providing a good document, written in LaTex, so 
that everyone can read, edit and share it. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/matteobonanomi/asuse200ha
```

Open *AsusE200HA_Linux_Guidelines.pdf* contained in *asuse200ha/latex* folder and have fun.

### Prerequisites

* One Asus E200HA netbook (or similar models... most of my suggestions apply to many other Asus Netbook with Intel Cherrytrail CPU)
* A Linux distro installed on it. Forget dual-boot, there's not enough memory. 


### Installing Linux

* **Choose your distro** in case you do not have any Linux distro installed yet, the first part of the guide will seggest you some examples of distro runnning smoothly on this netbook.

* **hardware and performance optimization** Read carefully and apply this guide step by step to optimize performance,
  reduce screen tearing, optimize battery life, solve multi-display conflicts and audio issues.

## Built With
