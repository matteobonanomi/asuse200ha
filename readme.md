# Asus E200HA: Linux distro installation and optimization guidelines

This manual aims at providing guidelines for the installation of Linux distros on 
Asus E200HA. This little and cheap netbook is not able to have decent performance with Windows 
and its ridiculous memory (32GB!!!) can't be enough for the heavy proprietary OS. Unfortunately, 
the hardware (Intel Cherrytrail... looking at you!) is not as linux-friendly as it should be, 
yet some good improvements can be made. I can guarantee that running Lubuntu or Manjaro Linux on this netbook provides
a user experience far way more confortable than Windows does. 

## Getting Started

At the time of writing, I am mostly working on providing a good document, written in LaTex, so 
that everyone can read, edit and share it. Clone this repo or just download AsusE200HA_Linux_Guidelines.pdf and have fun!

### Prerequisites

Of course you need to have a AsusE200HA netbook with you! You don't necessarily need to have a 
distro already installed on it. In fact, the first part of the guide willl suggest some distros, 
like Ubuntu 18.04 flavors or Manjaro Linux 17.x and above. I can ensure you that all the guidelines 
I mention are perfectly valid for any Debian-based, Ubuntu-based or Arch-based distro.

### Installing

* **clone this repo** as a first step. Open AsusE200HA_Linux_Guidelines.pdf.

* **Linux distribution**. I need to have a Linux distribution installed on your Asus netbook.
  Check the first part of the guide about suggested distro and install one of them. 
  In case you already have a distro installed, please try to understand if it's feasible with tour netbook hardware,
  since a lightweight distro is a mandatory starting point for the next steps.

* *hardware and performance optimization*. Read carefully and apply this guide step by step to optimize performance,
  reduce screen tearing, optimize battery life, solve multi-display conflicts and audio issues.
