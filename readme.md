# Asus E200HA: Linux distro installation and optimization guidelines

This manual provides some guidelines for the installation on Linux distros on 
Asus E200HA. Such a cheap netbook is not able to perform in a decent way with Windows. Most of the fault is due to 
a  ridiculous amount of disk space and a poor CPU. Unfortunately, 
the hardware (Intel Cherrytrail... looking at you!) is not as linux-friendly as it should be, 
yet some good improvements can be made. In particular, I will suggest you some tips to optimize 
performance, stability and battery life, as well as general adivices for the choice of a good 
distro for this netbook. 

## Getting Started

You are welcome to clone this repo and modify whatever you want.
A standard user should only download the pdf guide (AsusE200HA_Linux_Guidelines.pdf) and have fun!

In a near future, I will try to collect every step of the guide inside a bash script. For the 
moment, just read thhe guide... better to learn a little bit than just copy/paste in the 
terminal, isn't it?

### Prerequisites

Of course you need to have a AsusE200HA netbook with you! You don't necessarily need to have a 
distro already installed on it. In fact, the first part of the guide willl suggest some distros, 
like Ubuntu 18.04 flavors or Manjaro Linux 17.x and above.

I can ensure you that all the guidelines I mention are perfectly valid for any Debian-based, 
Ubuntu-based or Arch-based distro. Just pay attention specific distro version or flavor I will suggest you.
It is important to choose a good trade-off between up-to-date software and lightweight software! 

### Installing

This repo is not about installing Linux, it's about how to optimize it for our specific hardware.
Please read the suggested distros for this netbook and install one of them.

Carefully the PDF manual AsusE200HA_Linux_Guidelines.pdf and 
apply every tip step by step, trying to understand what we are doing and especially WHY we are 
doing so. Learning is better than copying!
